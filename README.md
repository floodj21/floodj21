I just finished up a class on Artificial Intelligence at Washington and Lee University. I am currently in a class entitled *Software Engineering for Web Applications*. 

I am interested in how to deploy TensorFlow, Keras, and neural networks in a broader sense to solve everyday problems. The world of AI is so new and I am excited to know a little bit about what is going on in this exciting field!
